<div class="entry-content"><p>Back in high school and college I used to write. Sometimes quite a lot.
Sometimes only for myself and sometimes I would publish them publicly. The
things I wrote were varied: thoughts, ideas, speeches, articles, reviews,
technology etc.</p>

<p>After I joined Microsoft I wasn&rsquo;t writing as much. I stopped doing public
speaking, so that dropped off completely. Thoughts and ideas were the first to
go. And for a while, I attempted to keep a technical blog (on my newly minted
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/cosmin/">MSDN</a> address), but that was also rather short lived. Slowly but surely,
the only things I would write were Facebook posts, and even those were mostly
check-ins and photos.</p>

<p>The excuses are many, and none unique: time, laziness, complacency. Carry a
notepad with me; what am I, a savage? Pen and paper are for my parents, I keep
everything digitally. But obviously I&rsquo;m not carrying a laptop with me all the
time. And typing on the phone, while appropriate for text messages, is rather
inconvenient for anything longer or formatted. After all, nobody reads the
things I publish, and nobody really knows about the things I don&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Somewhere along the way, I lost track of <strong>why</strong> I was writing in the first
place. It was to organize <em>my</em> thoughts. It was to improve <em>my</em> communication
skills. And it was for <em>me</em> to keep a history of things that I would otherwise
forget. It was never about getting other people&rsquo;s attention, and if a post I
wrote helped someone, great; but it was never a goal.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Luckily at Microsoft we used email. A lot. Too much actually, but that&rsquo;s for a
different time. Luckily, because it allowed me to continue fine-tuning my
communication skills. Most people who know me have realized at some point or
another that I choose my words very carefully, especially in written
communication. Being able to express yourself in a clear and concise manner is
non-trivial, and I&rsquo;ve witnessed many failures (my own included) on a daily
basis.</p>

<p>But other things started to fade away: I had to give a talk to a larger
audience once, and bombed completely. I wasn&rsquo;t really coming up with creative
thoughts anymore. And there were those small details I kept forgetting. Most
importantly though, I now realize an even bigger problem I was having: I wasn&rsquo;t
learning as much. I slowed down writing technical articles because the
technology I was using became very familiar to me, so I wasn&rsquo;t solving new
problems. Just like my writing was gone, so were my side projects, which in the
past were my outlet to working on things outside of work.</p>

<p>So I decided I need to fix this. A few months ago I got myself a nice
<a href="http://shop.moleskine.com/en-us/notebooks-journals/evernote/evernote-smart-notebook-pocket-ruled-hard-cover-black-6807">notebook</a> and a <a href="http://www.zebrapen.com/product/f-701-ball-point-retractable-2/">pen</a> I would enjoy writing with, and I keep them with
me almost at all times. I started sketching out thoughts, ideas and making
lists. Next, I started spending less time doing useless things (like watching
TV) and instead working on some side projects and learning new things. Since
work was all on the Microsoft stack, I decided my projects have to be
non-Microsoft. So I started learning <a href="http://golang.org">Go</a>, reading more papers and tech
articles and building libraries and small systems.</p>

<p>The last part is resuming writing a blog, which is where this post comes in.
Even as I had time last month in-between jobs, it was the one thing on my todo
list I kept procrastinating. So I&rsquo;ll apply the same strategy that I apply with
some of my other work I tend to procrastinate: make some public commitment
which forces me to actually do the work, even if subconsciously I know that
it&rsquo;s not really critical.</p>

<p>Over the next few weeks I&rsquo;ll write about my recent experiences with changing
jobs, the upcoming move from Seattle to San Francisco, new challenges I&rsquo;ll
discover in my new job, as well as stuff on the non-technical front. I don&rsquo;t
want to set a fixed cadence because I know that won&rsquo;t work. But writing these
words down and publishing them to the world, even if nobody reads them (and
chances are, few will), will make me write posts. Which will help <em>me</em>. And if
they help anyone else, well that&rsquo;s just the cherry on top.</p>
