<div class="entry-content"><p>Before these last few months, I couldn&rsquo;t really remember my last interview. I
remembered <em>some</em> of them, but not really in any order, so couldn&rsquo;t tell you
exactly the <em>last</em> one. The last &ldquo;burst&rdquo; of interviews I had was in college,
when I was applying for internships. Microsoft (the one I took) was among the
list, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure it wasn&rsquo;t the last one. During my time there, I
changed teams several times, but never had to interview.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>So you can imagine how I was feeling when I realized that I have do something
moderately stressful, with high impact towards my career, and that I had not
practiced in years. Arguably my only saving grace was that I did perform many
interviews (read: interviewer), and while that&rsquo;s no substitute, I do feel it
helped because I was more comfortable in the interview room and interacting with
the interviewer.</p>

<h1>TODO</h1>

<p>So why am I writing this post? Primarily for future me. Assuming things go as
planned and I don&rsquo;t have to interview for a few years, I&rsquo;ll be back in a similar
step as a few months ago, so this will help me remember some of the details I&rsquo;d
normally write down. Secondarily for anyone else who has a fear of technical
interviews. And from what I&rsquo;ve read online (while trying to deal with my own
fears), there&rsquo;s quite a few people.</p>

<p>The details below cover the entire process: prep, communication, phone screens,
interviews and (hopefully) offers. Given how personal this experience is, YMMV,
so apply your own filters on top of mine.</p>

<h3>The resume</h3>

<h1>TODO</h1>

<p>(Gayle: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-PM-Interview-Product-Technology/dp/0984782818/">http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-PM-Interview-Product-Technology/dp/0984782818/</a>)
I had a resume, and likely spent more time than I should on it. Even if we
narrow it down to technology roles and companies, it still varies quite a bit:
larger companies will require one, and depending on the funnel you&rsquo;re in (more
on that later), it may make a huge difference or be just a checkbox. Smaller
companies put less value on it, and some don&rsquo;t care about it at all.</p>

<p>But assuming you will have a resume, there are some very useful rules to follow:</p>

<ol>
<li>Your resume should not exceed one page. Period. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you&rsquo;re
applying for an internship or you have 20 years of experience. Yes, I
understand that in the latter case you&rsquo;ve done a lot in your life, but
unfortunately most of it (especially in tech) is not relevant anymore. Having
a one-page resume shows that you care about other people&rsquo;s time, and more
importantly that you can synthesize your thoughts in a concise manner. As an
interviewer, I can easily distill the last few things you&rsquo;ve worked on and
focus during an interview. If you have several pages (and I&rsquo;ve seen
candidates with double-digit number of pages), do you really think anyone
will ask you about about that COM issue you spent months on back in the
mid-nineties? Unless the job you&rsquo;re applying for requires experience with COM
(and you&rsquo;re masochistic enough to enjoy that), it&rsquo;s irrelevant.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t cheat to get a page in. Fonts should be readable, and spacing should be
making the resume read easily. Again, the people reading it spend somewhere
between 10-30 seconds on it on average, so do your best to make sure what&rsquo;s
important stands out as effortlessly as possible.</li>
<li>Now that you&rsquo;re really forced to focus on what&rsquo;s valuable, eliminate obvious
things which aren&rsquo;t. For example, listing all the different parts of
Microsoft Office, or even listing Office experience at all, is anti-climactic
at best. My parents know how to use Office. And I&rsquo;m pretty sure you couldn&rsquo;t
go through college now-a-days without acquiring basic skills in Word, Excel
and PowerPoint. So save yourself a line there for something more useful. The
same goes for operating systems. Unless you&rsquo;re applying for a sys admin
position which requires experience with a particular flavor of Linux or BSD,
it doesn&rsquo;t matter. Almost everyone has used Windows, and almost everyone can
use a Mac pretty effortlessly. That&rsquo;s two lines. The same goes for text
editors and IDEs: companies hire you for your experience in a certain domain
<strong>and</strong> the ability to pick up small things along the way, like Visual
Studio. I&rsquo;ll stop at three lines, since you get the gist of it.</li>
<li>Now that you&rsquo;re on your way to a 1-page resume that contains actually useful
information, spend at most an hour a day for at most a week. This will allow
you to refactor your resume while not wasting too much time on it. The main
value of a resume is to get you in the door. Once you&rsquo;re there, it
asymptotically approaches zero as you&rsquo;re progressing through the interviews.
In other words, there&rsquo;s more valuable things you can spend your time on, even
if it means your resume could be 1% better next week.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Prep&#8217;ing</h3>

<p>Most industries will hire people primarily based on their experience and a
couple of hours of chatting about behavioral questions. Sadly, the tech industry
primarily relies on 30ish-minute challenges which tend to focus on problems you
haven&rsquo;t seen since your university days. Some companies do better than others at
this, but at the end of the day it&rsquo;s worthwhile to get a [book][1] or [two][2]
and go through the problems to get comfortable. At first, they seemed much more
difficult to me then they were. Then it got easier as I was getting into that
mindset. A few tricks that worked for me: you&rsquo;ll almost always have to use a
hash. Linked lists are likely the second most valuable data structure to apply,
and it will likely be doubly-linked. Trees are primarily useful for lower-level
things (like file system and database questions). They also make for good
&ldquo;warm-up&rdquo; problems where the interviewer can ask you to traverse a binary tree
non-recursively. Don&rsquo;t spend much time on any problem in the book whose solution
is larger than 1-1.5 pages: interviewers don&rsquo;t typically have entire walls of
whiteboards, and they don&rsquo;t expect you to wipe parts of it just to make space,
so you won&rsquo;t see them. I would recommend going through the solutions and
understanding them though since <em>parts</em> of many times those problems can be
broken down into smaller parts that can show up in an interview.</p>

<p>Timebox your studying. Otherwise you&rsquo;ll both spend too little and too much time
on it: too little each day to remember things, and too much in terms of the
number of weeks it will take you to finish a book. Somewhere between two weeks
and one month seems to be the sweet spot.</p>

<h3>Research</h3>

<p>Most people don&rsquo;t have a single company in mind they want to work on, and if
they do, it&rsquo;s probably because they don&rsquo;t know about other ones. Spend some time
to reflect on the kind of companies you&rsquo;d like to work on: the location, the
size and the specific areas they&rsquo;re in. Then find companies that match that
criteria. If you&rsquo;re looking at bigger companies (i.e. Microsoft, Google,
Amazon), the search is easier and primarily consists of [Glassdoor][3]. If
you&rsquo;re looking at smaller companies and start-ups, then [Crunchbase][4],
[AngeList][5] and [Hacker News][6] will be much more useful. Once you find the
companies which match your criteria, find a couple of companies that are
slightly off, they&rsquo;ll come in handy for your practice.</p>

<h3>The B-list</h3>

<p>Unless you&rsquo;re interviewing on a regular basis (which is also typically a bad
sign), you&rsquo;re rusty at it. Of course it&rsquo;s easier for everyone if you applied to
your dream company and got in and then you&rsquo;re done, but chances are it&rsquo;s not
going to happen. There&rsquo;s a much higher probability that you&rsquo;ll make some silly
mistakes and bomb your first few interviews, so instead use them on companies
you don&rsquo;t really plan on working at. The companies on this &ldquo;B-list&rdquo; should still
be tangentially related to your &ldquo;A-list&rdquo;, just that if you don&rsquo;t get an offer it
won&rsquo;t hurt your feelings. Choose two or three of these and do more if you still
need it afterwards. Try to schedule them all within one/two weeks so you&rsquo;re not
wasting your time on it and getting through as quickly as possible.</p>

<h3>Applying</h3>

<p>All companies have a /jobs or /careers page. Use it to find the jobs you&rsquo;re
interested in, but try to find other ways to apply for them. As you can imagine,
those pages tend to put you in a pile of candidates and there&rsquo;s less of a chance
of being noticed. Instead, try to find a more personal avenue to get in: if
looking at larger companies, go to one of the numerous events they host and try
to meet some of the employees. If it&rsquo;s a smaller company, be more active in
their community and reach out to employees which are part of those communities
(i.e. Twitter, IRC, discussion lists). If you don&rsquo;t have any of those options,
then go ahead and submit a general jobs application: if the company is good,
typically their recruiting department is also good, and you&rsquo;ll be in good hands.
If their recruiting department is less good, it&rsquo;s likely the first of many
problems you&rsquo;re seeing with the company.</p>

<p>Cold emails can sometimes help as well, assuming they&rsquo;re done properly and with
the right audience. For example, I applied to some small start-ups with whom I
had no contact before, and I did so by email their CEO or CTO. Some of them got
back to me, others simply forwarded my email to their recruiter (which is still
better than the general queue of applicants), and others I never heard from. I
wouldn&rsquo;t recommend this approach with a company larger in size for obvious
reasons.</p>

<h3>The phone chat</h3>

<p>An engineer&rsquo;s time is pretty expensive, and companies typically create a funnel
to prevent wasting their time as much as possible. In most of my experiences I
got to talk to some non-technical person first. They likely work in recruiting
or HR, and aren&rsquo;t there to necessarily probe you on technical skills. They&rsquo;re
there to make sure there&rsquo;s a good match with what they&rsquo;re looking for based on
your interests and past experience. They are also the people who will schedule
the rest of your interviews, and they also have the ability to stop your
interview at that point.</p>

<p>Because there&rsquo;s not really much to study for this, schedule them pretty early
on. It will not only help get the actual interviews scheduled (they take time),
but will also help answer questions about the company which may not be readily
available. In my case, there were a few companies that got cut from my list
after chatting with the recruiters because I realized they wouldn&rsquo;t be a good
match.</p>

<h3>The phone interview</h3>

<p>After talking to a recruiter, you&rsquo;ll typically have at least one if not two
phone screens. If you&rsquo;re a local candidate (i.e. the only cost for the company
is their engineers&#8217; time) you&rsquo;ll probably have just one. If you&rsquo;re applying to a
US company but live in another city, you may get away with one phone screen if
you do well. International candidates will likely have two phone screens due to
the higher cost and bigger process.</p>

<p>Most companies will have use two methods of communication during an interview: a
phone and some collaborative editor. A few used Skype or Google Hangouts and
then I enabled screen sharing. If given a choice, I&rsquo;d recommend Skype/Hangouts
option since it allows you to use your favorite editor or IDE.</p>

<p>The problems asked are typically a level or two easier than an in-person
interview. The primary purpose of a phone screen is to weed out obviously poor
candidates. Interviewers want to make sure you can write some code and have
basic problem solving skills. Communication is also important here, especially
since you&rsquo;re not in the same room as the other person.</p>

<p>Many times there&rsquo;s a few days delay between the phone screen and the next time
you&rsquo;re contacted. Don&rsquo;t freak out, and the best way to deal with this is to ask
the phone screener at the end when you should expect to hear back from them. All
good companies will reach out to the candidates regardless of result.</p>

<h3>The interview day</h3>

<p>You&rsquo;ve been dreading this day since the moment you decided to apply, yet you
knew it was inevitable. Your day will consist of 3-7 interviews depending on the
company, all likely involving something technical (an exception could be the
last one). The majority of them will ask you to write actual code either on a
whiteboard or laptop, and a few of them will ask you to design some system.</p>

<p>There shouldn&rsquo;t be many surprises here. You&rsquo;ll likely not see any of the
problems you practiced since interviewers also know about them. If you do, it&rsquo;s
much better to tell them upfront that you&rsquo;ve seen a problem rather than try to
fake it. Best case scenario, you just earned honesty points, and the interviewer
will either still ask you to go through it or give you another problem, while
being more willing to help you out because he appreciated the honesty. Worst
case you pretend to not know the problem while it&rsquo;s obvious that you do, and the
interviewer gives you another problem, while being less willing to help you out
because you lied to them.</p>

<p>Talk. Before you write a line of code. Preferably before you even design stuff
in too much detail. Most of the time there&rsquo;s other information you need to come
to a reasonable solution that matches what the interviewer expects. And you&rsquo;ll
likely get stuck along the way because it&rsquo;s a new problem and there&rsquo;s a lot of
pressure. By talking to the interviewer you&rsquo;re helping him help you. If a
candidate simply stares at a whiteboard, there&rsquo;s very little information one can
extract to help them out. On the other hand, if you talk about what specifically
you&rsquo;re thinking of and what options you&rsquo;re considering, the interviewer may
decide to jump in and help as necessary.</p>

<p>Take your time. Don&rsquo;t take too much time, but be pragmatic about it. Write clean
code and is readable, leave appropriate amounts of space for things you likely
forgot to add, and be methodical about it. Solving a problem in a chaotic
fashion is almost the same as not solving it. Ultimately interviewers aren&rsquo;t
looking for you to just get a problem; they&rsquo;re looking whether you have the
right skills to solve a problem. At the end of the day, you&rsquo;re (hopefully) not
solving known problems in your job, so the journey is much more valuable than
the result this time.</p>

<h3>The wait</h3>

<p>If you thought that the phone screen delay was long&hellip; the delay between your
last interview and the decision tends to be much longer. It&rsquo;s not just a yes/no
decision. If it&rsquo;s a yes, then details factor in, primarily the details of your
offer. Depending on the company, those details can decided by one person who was
in your interview loop, or may have to go through multiple people, each of whom
take time. A similar strategy to the phone screen applies here for not freaking
out: ask the last interviewer what the next steps are and their timeframe. If
they don&rsquo;t know (many times engineers don&rsquo;t know HRish details), just send the
recruiter you were in contact with an email <strong>that same day</strong> thanking them for
the experience and time, and asking what the timeframe for the next steps are.</p>

<h3>The offer</h3>

<p>Congratulations, you got an offer! Hopefully it was from one of the A-list
companies and not just the practice rounds. Depending on how you&rsquo;ve timed your
interviews, all your offers may come in about the same time or have a bigger
delay. It&rsquo;s reasonable to expect at least a week to respond, and responding
doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean accepting/declining. Like anything else in life,
there&rsquo;s typically room for negotiation. If you like the offer you got and are
pleased with all the terms, then you don&rsquo;t <em>have</em> to negotiate.</p>

<p>Like any other negotiation, it&rsquo;s about leverage. If you only have one offer and
hate your current job, there&rsquo;s little incentive for the company to offer you
ore, especially if the offer was fair.</p>
