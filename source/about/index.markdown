## WhoAmI

I currently work as a Software Engineer at [Stripe][3] in San Francisco, CA. 
Previously I was working at Microsoft building large scale services like Office 365 and Azure.

I've spent most of my professional career building highly available services,
designing intuitive APIs that are as simple as possible, and writing extensible libraries
that others can use to solve their problems.

In my free time I enjoy (in no particular order):

* Beer & wine
* Eating delicious food
* Learning new things (both technical and non-technical)
* Running
* Sports
* Stand-up comedy
* Tea
* Traveling
* Watching movies

I don't drink coffee, but find coffee houses some of the most productive places to work (and luckily most serve tea).

## Contact

I check my email quite often and am generally responsive.
Please don't hesitate to reach out if you want to talk about technical topics,
suggestions for new articles, feedback on past articles and in general
interesting (preferably technical) problems.
I typically do tend to ignore random impersonal recruiters or mass emails.

#### Email

As mentioned earlier, this is by far the most effective way to reach out to me and start a dialog.
My email address can easily be found online. 

#### GitHub

I like to spend time going through code. If you're faced with any tough problems or have some 
awesome code, just send me a link to your project and I'll add it to my queue.
Conversely, if you have any feedback for code in [my repositories][2], I would love to hear about it
either via an Issue, Pull Request or Email. 

#### LinkedIn

I will gladly accept connection requests from people, but rarely read any messages sent there. 
I tend to keep my profile light, but up-to-date.

#### Twitter

I currently use Twitter as a source of information rather than broadcasting. 
That being said, if you have a quick note, feel free to send me one [@getCos][1].

## What you'll find here

I used to spend quite a bit of time writing in college about a range of topics. I found that
after graduating, the majority of my writing has been in the form of emails or papers. Like anything
else in this world, you only get better at things by practicing, and the reverse is even more
applicable: you forget things even faster when you don't practice them. 

I find the ability to *precisely* and *accuretly* communicate information is crucial in today's
day and age, especially when it comes to technical things. As such, I plan on using this place
to go back to my writing roots and make sure not only that I don't lose those skills, and maybe
even help others improve theirs through examples.

Articles typically belong in one of the following categories:

* Interesting technical problems. These are typically accompanied by code.
* Rants, which may or may not include any code.
* Non-technical subjects (food, traveling etc.) that have nothing to do with code.
