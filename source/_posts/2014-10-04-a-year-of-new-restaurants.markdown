Seattle is a city full of great restaurants with amazing food. And after living
there for four years, I'm pretty happy that I probably ate at ~80% of them. But
that means that there's still probably over a dozen places that are really tasty
that I didn't try out. Even in my last few weeks living there, I was finding
little gems in the form of lunch trucks around the city or small places in
Pike's Place. Given that SF has at least an order of magnitude more restaurants,
and the average quality is higher due to the inherent competition, a new
strategy was needed.

###The paradox

The reality is that, in cities like San Francisco and Seattle, most restaurants
have some good food. A high number of them have exceptional food. And a few
special have something you can't find anywhere else (like [Paseo][0] and
[Salumi][1]). And this is where the paradox comes in: once you have a set of
good restaurants, you're guaranteed to have a tasty meal. But by going to the
same places, you're missing out on discovering another delicious
restaurant, at the risk of being slightly disappointed occasionally. 

###The plot
Since I suffer from the "once you find something good, stick to it" syndrome, I
needed to create something which breaks the usual pattern. So, over the course
of the summer I've been planning a little adventure for San Francisco:
**over the course of a year, I will not go to the same restaurant twice**. This
will act as a forcing function to try out a new place of similar (or
completely new) cuisine.

###The exceptions

Like anything with rules, there are exceptions. The list below exists not to
allow me to game the game I set up for myself, but to set expectations for
scenarios I *know* could result in a check-in to the same place.

* Work lunch places -- there's only a few around anyone's work
  place, and when I go it's typically in a group.
* Takeout/Delivery places -- similarly, there's only a few around anyone's home,
  and it's very convenient to be able to get some dinner late at night.
* Brunch vs. Dinner -- the same restaurant can be repeated if one of the meals
  is a brunch and another is dinner. The menus are typically completely
  different, so it's really like trying out two different restaurants.
* Out of town visitors -- hopefully friends from Seattle or other parts of the
  world will come to SF. When they do, I want to be able to take them to the
  best places.
* Group events -- if someone wants to have their birthday at a restaurant I
  already ate at, it would be pretty awkward to try to convince them to go
  somewhere else because of my silly rules; and it would be a shame to not be
  able to join them.

###The details

So, between October 1st, 2014 - October 1st, 2015:

* you should not see two check-ins at the same restaurant.
* when checking in, each restaurant will get one of the following ratings:
  *Sucks I can't try it out for another year*; *Meh, probably not coming back
  for a year anyways* or *It's going to be much longer than a year
  until I come back here*. 
* Exceptional places may end up with a blog entry along with some pictures.

There's quite a few people I mentioned this to, who don't think I can pull it
through. And given my habits in Seattle, I do agree it's going to require lots of
discipline. At the very least, it should make for some fun stories and hopefully
great food.
