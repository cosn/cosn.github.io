  <div class="entry-content"><p>Seattle is a city full of terrific restaurants with amazing food. And after living
there for four years, I&rsquo;m pretty happy that I probably ate at ~80% of them. But
that means that there&rsquo;s still probably over a dozen places that are really tasty
which I didn&rsquo;t try out. Even in my last few weeks living there, I was finding
little gems, in the form of lunch trucks around the city or small places in
Pike&rsquo;s Place. Given that SF has at least an order of magnitude more restaurants,
and the average quality is higher due to the inherent competition, a new
strategy was needed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This week was my first week at <a href="https://www.stripe.com">Stripe</a>, and so far it&rsquo;s been a thrilling
experience, even though my mind is still coping with the overload of
information it&rsquo;s been subjected to. The people have been extremely friendly and
welcoming. The office is both great and in a great location. The food is tasty
and the beer selection is spectacular.</p>

<p>I wanted to outline some of the details of my on-boarding process, and compare
it to my previous on-boarding at Microsoft. Also, as someone who&rsquo;s been using
various enterprise technologies from Microsoft, I was very curious to see what
the equivalents are in a small company, so this post will outline many of them.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Back in high school and college I used to write. Sometimes quite a lot.
Sometimes only for myself and sometimes I would publish them publicly. The
things I wrote were varied: thoughts, ideas, speeches, articles, reviews,
technology etc.</p>

<p>After I joined Microsoft I wasn&rsquo;t writing as much. I stopped doing public
speaking, so that dropped off completely. Thoughts and ideas were the first to
go. And for a while, I attempted to keep a technical blog (on my newly minted
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/cosmin/">MSDN</a> address), but that was also rather short lived. Slowly but surely,
the only things I would write were Facebook posts, and even those were mostly
check-ins and photos.</p>

<p>The excuses are many, and none unique: time, laziness, complacency. Carry a
notepad with me; what am I, a savage? Pen and paper are for my parents, I keep
everything digitally. But obviously I&rsquo;m not carrying a laptop with me all the
time. And typing on the phone, while appropriate for text messages, is rather
inconvenient for anything longer or formatted. After all, nobody reads the
things I publish, and nobody really knows about the things I don&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Somewhere along the way, I lost track of <strong>why</strong> I was writing in the first
place. It was to organize <em>my</em> thoughts. It was to improve <em>my</em> communication
skills. And it was for <em>me</em> to keep a history of things that I would otherwise
forget. It was never about getting other people&rsquo;s attention, and if a post I
wrote helped someone, great; but it was never a goal.</p>
